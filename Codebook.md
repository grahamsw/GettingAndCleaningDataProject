#Codebook for tidy data

The data for this project is available from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

See [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) for more details.

The variables output in the tidyData.txt are all averages, per user/activity combination of the labelled variables. These variables are described, somewhat, in features_info.txt in the zipped collection of documents. This does **not** include information.
